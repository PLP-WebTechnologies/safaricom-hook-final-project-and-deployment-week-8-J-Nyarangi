Here is a **README.md** file for your **EverMall** project, structured similarly to the **Modern Blog Website** template you provided. I have incorporated sections like **Features**, **Project Architecture**, **User Flow**, and more. Additionally, I added **Mermaid diagrams** and **JavaScript classes** to make the documentation more visually appealing and professional:
